# JS-Chess

### About the Project
This project is a simple chess game built using vanilla JavaScript. It is a playable game, but it is still in the early stages of development. The game is played on a 64-square board, with 8 rows and 8 columns. 

This project was built as a way to learn more about JavaScript. It was also a fun challenge to try to build a complete game using only vanilla JavaScript.

The project is still under development, and there are a number of features that I would like to add in the future. These features include:

- A timer: This would add an element of strategy and urgency to the game. Players would have to think carefully about their moves and make sure they don't run out of time.
- A move list: This would allow players to see all of the moves that have been made in the game, which could be helpful for learning and analyzing the game.
- An AI opponent: This would allow players to play against a computer, which could be a more challenging and rewarding experience, additionally also allow players to choose different levels of difficulty for the AI opponent.
- A better user interface: use React to create a more interactive and user-friendly UI which would make the game more visually appealing and easier to use.
- Add Database: use MySQL to store the data for your chess game. The database would contain tables for the pieces, the moves, and the scores.This would also allow you to track the rankings of the players over time.
- Setup Backend Services: use Spring Boot to create a REST API for your chess game. This API would expose endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting games, as well as for retrieving the current state of a game.
- Bug fixes: No game is perfect, so it's always a good idea to fix any bugs that you find.
- Social features: add social features such as the ability to friend other players, chat with them, and challenge them to games. This would make the game more social and engaging.
- AWS:  use AWS to host your chess game on an EC2 instance. You could also use AWS S3 to store the static assets for your game, such as the images of the pieces.
- Docker: use Docker to package your chess game into a container. This would allow you to easily deploy your game to different environments, such as AWS or your local machine, additionally you can also use Docker to test your chess game in different environments. This would allow you to ensure that your game works correctly in different environments.
- Kubernetes: can use Kubernetes to deploy your chess game to a cluster of servers. This would allow you to scale your game up or down as needed
  
I am also open to suggestions for other features that could be added to the game. If you have any suggestions, please submit a pull request (PR) to the GitHub repository.
